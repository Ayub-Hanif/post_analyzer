Both Bluesky the app and AtProto the protocol are open source projects, so the code is out there for the world to use.

Most of my experience is based on wazuh's design, it now uses per-agent sqlite, and frequently runs into problems. But it's very write intensive.

I've written my own ledgers based on ext4 directly, when mariadb is overkill, but time to give sqlite a go, Reply ID: 872283495 Content: Doesn't the per user db make the aggregation a lot more expensive and difficult to scale?

2. SQLite is used on the PDS, stored on the local (NVMe SSD). Each (of us) users has our own SQLite database for our atproto repository data.

Post ID: 29077722 Content: Yup, there are almost fifteen million SQLite databases on Bluesky’s PDS servers. It’s wildly efficient and simple but not without trade offs of course.

Makes sense for this use case in large part because each users atproto repository is self contained, with links to other repos, like a website.

1. Complete API packages (more code, might be slower to compile, easy to adopt)
2. Pick-what-you-need packages (core is provided, uses a SwiftPM plugin to generate only a list of operations, faster to compile, more steps to adopt)

Both make sense.]

Post ID: -2025412869 Content: Hi, there's some crashing errors for blueskyfeeds.com right now that's causing the server to reset as a feed is being submitted. 
I'll be temporarily pausing feed editing until I fix it. Might take a few hours as I debug.

Here’s 2 quick diagrams I made on how the 2 work.

Imagine them becoming 1-100 Gbit/s.

What H2 streams help with is lowering the cost of making huge numbers of individual HTTP requests.

Like 1-100k concurrent streams over a single TCP connection!

BUT it’s probably too heavyweight and Postgres’s fatal flaw is how poorly it scales with high concurrency and high connection counts, so wouldn’t work well in, for example, the case of the Bluesky PDS implementation.

IMO, what's exciting ab ATP is its "everything-is-public" design re all user data

We used to be beholden to APIs of walled gardens (& saw how that turned out)

But once you build on ATP (assuming you don't EEE),all interop comes for free!

I switched the bot over to use Jetstream, which hopefully means less backed up firehose processing!

Also added more logging and metrics to make future handling easier.

That being said, ECDSA is a horrible protocol & I wouldn't be surprised if there's no way to do this. Schnorr sigs maybe.

No one can force existing legacy social apps to adopt a new protocol like atproto or open their APIs, so how can it be compatible?

What we can do is make atproto an open standard and network which new social apps can use to interoperate.

And that's exactly the goal of atproto/Bluesky.

Again, read what I said before. You're grossly underestimating the amount of effort that needs to go into protocol design., Reply ID: -622995393 Content: > "simply use a bog-standard AP protocol stack" in addition to #atproto.

I suggest you try spend one hour trying to design such a dual-head instance. There are a lot of issues to work out with regards to mapping identifiers between the two protocols, and ensuring that data can flow both ways.]

Post ID: -1327268169 Content: Question for #atproto #atdev:

Does "post.record.embed" *always* exist 1:1 to "post.embed" ?? 🤔

ie. Is it ever possible one exists without the other?

TIA!! 🙏 #buildinpublic

PS. Here's the hydrated posts URL I'm looking at: public.api.bsky.app/xrpc/app.bsk...

I'm certain that `post.embed` cannot exist without `post.record.embed`. 🧵]

To me the idea of building a network that can financially support Bsky has a ton of potential that I think folks aren't even seeing yet. And it can be done ethically.

Users already have an "atproto account" (a DID and PDS) and can reuse the social graph (if it makes sense and they want to).

But of course still requires building something people want.

Post ID: 2029419721 Content: My #Swiftlang #AProto API library, ATProtoKit, has been updated to 0.21.0.

The way you authenticate has been tweaked a little. This will help with implementing OAuth but managing the session should hopefully be a little easier.

More tweaks will be on the way, but this is the first step.

Do the self hosted PDS send the data to the relay as it is created or do the relays query the PDS? Do relays communicate with other relays?

You still need a resolver, and you can own your own domain name, so I don't see how a DID is functionally any different from a DNS based identity.

You're just moving the ownership of your identity from ICANN to some other system.

If I enter <handle> and <password>, look up the DID doc and make a call to the right PDS automatically. The field could be purely optional if you want to override it somehow, or if you want to log in with the email.]

Post ID: 1506921037 Content: Once you know someone's handle, you can easily look up what their PDS hostname is, it's just two extra HTTP requests, to resolve the handle and to the plc directory (but it could be done while the user is busy entering the password)
