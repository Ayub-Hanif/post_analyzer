You still need a resolver, and you can own your own domain name, so I don't see how a DID is functionally any different from a DNS based identity.

You're just moving the ownership of your identity from ICANN to some other system.

Post: Something I've been a bit confused by with #atproto is how to the relay firehoses discover content on the individual PDS, so that it is aggregates?

Do the self hosted PDS send the data to the relay as it is created or do the relays query the PDS? Do relays communicate with other relays?

The way you authenticate has been tweaked a little. This will help with implementing OAuth but managing the session should hopefully be a little easier.

More tweaks will be on the way, but this is the first step.

Post: I think there is a discoverability problem surrounding what #atproto can and can't do.

It's not that the documentation doesn't exist, I think it's more of a: here is a bunch of lego bricks when folks are looking for a kit with easy to follow instructions.

Post: atproto posts are already signed so that step is taken care of. 

In other words, you can be confident that a post is signed by the handle you see that created it.

What users need help with is quickly identifying that "alice.reuters.com" a Reuters account not "alice.rueters.com" or something funky.

Post: Ideally, we'd keep only the commit, records, and their path names. The Merkle Search Tree can be rebuilt.

However, I don't think there is an efficient way to know what records have been deleted without rebuilding the graph (see atproto.com/specs/reposi...) and I'd like to be almost write-only.

Why is this? I revoked the password but it still works?

Post: 5/ So, how can Bluesky unlock its next wave of growth?

It‚Äôs simple: double down on the users driving the current wave. Empower them to spread the word.

Example: Developers. A program to build on #atprotocol (custom feeds, decentralized identities) could create entirely new value‚Äîand viral loops.

Post: 3/ Bluesky‚Äôs growth isn‚Äôt about ‚Äúluck.‚Äù It‚Äôs about timing and value.

Developers + early adopters + the #atprotocol (custom feeds, decentralized identities, open infrastructure) = the foundation to spark the next wave of users.


But is this enough to keep momentum growing? Let‚Äôs break it down.

Post: A PDS is your atproto repository in the cloud. It stores your posts/likes/follows/etc and acts as a proxy to the network for your client.

For technical people, it's very low effort to run your own PDS. You rent a ~$5/mo server and run the handy installer script.

Not at all necessary but it's cool!

Post: Yup! And #atproto has a lot of pieces for this.

Unlike a blockchain, the data is logically decentralized, and the relay creates an index (that anyone can run) that gives a centralized view.

It avoids the Etherscan problem! Or at least, multiple people can run one.

Post: Hey #atdev -- does anyone have an XRPC endpoint tester? What I mean is: I want a tool where I don't have to manage tokens, I just put in the credentials, and go hit some endpoints. atproto-proxy support is mandatory, that's what I'll need to debug my app with.

Post: Today in insane questions nobody should be asking: is it safe to deliberately leak an #oauth #oidc token with no access privileges?

The intent would be to allow a arbitrary third party to validate an OIDC token to prove proof of identity, as a form of verification for #atproto accounts.

Exactly!

It‚Äôs not really practical to make interoperable social apps with HTML and HTTP alone.

You need a protocol like atproto to define how data should be stored and identities referenced.

And one that shows upon maybe an easy little ellipses expansion at the end of the visible labels.

Post: 2/2 "terminal values" vs "instrumental values". IMO, decentralization is *not* a terminal value (not for me, at least). My terminal value is *owning my own data* & "credible exit" which #atproto enables. I understand bPBC is currently the only one composing. But I hope soon, others will compose too.

Post: Ok second #atproto question - to hydrate my appview, I can put it in front of the relay, easy enough.

I've also successfully done JIT single-user hydration by waiting until I need data and then `com.atproto.sync.getRepo`'ing a replay of their content directly from their PDS. Any problems there?

Should I roll with the whole @subdomain.domain.TLD or just @domain.TLD?

Pluses or minuses?  Thoughts?

Post: #Postgres people: what's your advice for how I should configure how it uses memory etc.? I think it uses much less than MySQL now (a couple hundred MB) but does way more disk reading, so it could be caching more (this is a 8 GB RAM instance).

Post: Yup, there are almost fifteen million SQLite databases on Bluesky‚Äôs PDS servers. It‚Äôs wildly efficient and simple but not without trade offs of course.

Makes sense for this use case in large part because each users atproto repository is self contained, with links to other repos, like a website.

That said, these 3 things would expand that trust greatly:

(3) Fine grained oauth... right now it's way too broad.

Post: My suggestion is to look at the #atproto feed. They might help you achieve your goal. Potentially cheaply.

Post: So this is actually one of my Qs with #atproto. The way ATP works is that all posts/likes/blocks are by default "global public". *Anyone* can scrape them. W/ FB & X, only Zuck & Elon had access to the user data (easily). Now everyone can easily access the user data. The Q now: is this what we want?

Post: Farcaster is an interesting social protocol - but in its current state it simply cannot be considered a replacement for big-world networks like Twitter or Bluesky. The same is true of Nostr - people aren't ready to own their keys and don't trust Web3 (yet).

Post: imo atproto is in a better place than AP in this regard because the data is by nature location-independent and very easy to backup (i know several folks have full network mirrors)

atproto also provides a story around adversarial hosting migration that to my knowledge AP doesn't have

Post: As we see more apps built on atproto maybe we will see something like "connect atproto" become more common as the button?

What do you think? Or will it be Bluesky?
