It isn't a lot of data per user (just a list of words). Would this be possible?

1. Bluesky Social, PBC asserts no ownership over your identity or data.

2. You can take your identity and data and do what you want with them.

3. The atproto protocol is designed specifically around this idea, and the power of users on it will only get stronger.

It's definitely feasible to just do battle with abusers using connection/rate limiting and IP bans, and that's what I'd prefer.

Public atproto repos publish data that is supposed to be easily scraped, fetched, and indexed.

If Relays don't offer good service then devs will hit PDS hosts.

And if both are locked down the goal of an open network will suffer.

There *might* be some way to change this in the future.

Also, likes on Twitter weren't private until X did it recently.

Is there any reason bsky.social fails when calling resolveHandle, if the user is self hosting? See for example:

 curl -G --data-urlencode "handle=sergio.bsky.col.social" bsky.social/xrpc/com.atp...

For technical people, it's very low effort to run your own PDS. You rent a ~$5/mo server and run the handy installer script.

Post ID: -1708759861 Content: im curious about how bluesky handles moderation across federation #atproto

if a user on their own PDS posts something against bluesky TOS but not illegal, how would it be handled?

would they either:
1. be added to the main moderation list 
2. be de-federated from the relay/ pds
3. something else

Currently storing lots of stuff as jsonb.  It's not horrible but it feels a litle... chunky.

But I think atproto and Bluesky are ready for investors just looking to make a big ROI.

It's designed well enough to be resistant to corruption, benefit from the investment, and make money.

Post ID: 2029419721 Content: My #Swiftlang #AProto API library, ATProtoKit, has been updated to 0.21.0.

The way you authenticate has been tweaked a little. This will help with implementing OAuth but managing the session should hopefully be a little easier.

More tweaks will be on the way, but this is the first step.

Post ID: 458896990 Content: Something I've been a bit confused by with #atproto is how to the relay firehoses discover content on the individual PDS, so that it is aggregates?

Do the self hosted PDS send the data to the relay as it is created or do the relays query the PDS? Do relays communicate with other relays?

Post ID: 250005839 Content: Somebody please mansplain why DIDs are better than URLs?

You still need a resolver, and you can own your own domain name, so I don't see how a DID is functionally any different from a DNS based identity.

You're just moving the ownership of your identity from ICANN to some other system.

Man, fuckin URLs are portable too! Move your website to a new domain and the relative links will still work. Only the domain has to change, which is exactly the case if you move your DID to another resolver.]

Playing with #atprotocol SDK today

and learned that #bluesky uses a concept of
"rich text facets" to handle special decorated text
(e.g. tags, links, mentions)

Fortunately we can just call a helper func
to detect all 'facets' within a text and move on üë®‚Äçüíª
