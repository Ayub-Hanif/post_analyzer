How to measure it right?, Reply ID: -952885669 Content: I would like to add the "Bluesky Feeds" dominance metric, I think this is where the dominance could theoretically be the lowest. But for that we would need to have some aggregated data on what Feeds users are using., Reply ID: 300305414 Content: This is great!

For Relays, AppViews, Clients and Moderation it says ‚Äújust an estimate; not enough data‚Äù.

Having some tracking issues/discussions somewhere for how to acquire that data would be very useful., Reply ID: 1429217357 Content: üìå, Reply ID: -43262247 Content: do you know if there‚Äôs something similar for ActivityPub and Mastodon?]

1. Complete API packages (more code, might be slower to compile, easy to adopt)
2. Pick-what-you-need packages (core is provided, uses a SwiftPM plugin to generate only a list of operations, faster to compile, more steps to adopt)

Both make sense.]

IMO, what's exciting ab ATP is its "everything-is-public" design re all user data

We used to be beholden to APIs of walled gardens (& saw how that turned out)

But once you build on ATP (assuming you don't EEE),all interop comes for free!

Post ID: 553311214 Content: Just finished migrating my VPS to a server in Seattle, and it's performing much better connecting to the firehose at bsky.network than in San Jose. 

Hopefully that copes well enough with the user surge for now. I'm still working on a faster v2 to be launched early next month, hopefully.

I really do think there's a convergence possible over time with all the best ideas we can come up with collectively.

Because it's just not that hard to migrate a completely open data system to a new one!

A future version of atproto could be very different and better from the current version!

No one can force existing legacy social apps to adopt a new protocol like atproto or open their APIs, so how can it be compatible?

What we can do is make atproto an open standard and network which new social apps can use to interoperate.

And that's exactly the goal of atproto/Bluesky.

Again, read what I said before. You're grossly underestimating the amount of effort that needs to go into protocol design., Reply ID: -684737620 Content: > "simply use a bog-standard AP protocol stack" in addition to #atproto.

I suggest you try spend one hour trying to design such a dual-head instance. There are a lot of issues to work out with regards to mapping identifiers between the two protocols, and ensuring that data can flow both ways.]

Kubernetes is also good at making people hate infrastructure...

The reference PDS implementation is very simple to run on a VM though. It even auto-updates the container image.

For technical people, it's very low effort to run your own PDS. You rent a ~$5/mo server and run the handy installer script.

Post ID: 846614176 Content: @aoc.bsky.social it took me a bit of time to find your user in Bsky even after crossing 1M followers (congrats!)

then I realized you don't use your www.ocasiocortez.com domain as user handle in #atproto! 

you can build greater identity #trust on the network by leveraging your domain

But there's talk of implementing a much more complicated centralized verification service, which is a lot more code, much more complicated, and much worse in my opinion.

if a user on their own PDS posts something against bluesky TOS but not illegal, how would it be handled?

would they either:
1. be added to the main moderation list 
2. be de-federated from the relay/ pds
3. something else

Isn‚Äôt building a business around #atproto kind of like saying you‚Äôre going to build a business around #http? Neither of those is a differentiator that allows you to build a moat.

The way you authenticate has been tweaked a little. This will help with implementing OAuth but managing the session should hopefully be a little easier.

You still need a resolver, and you can own your own domain name, so I don't see how a DID is functionally any different from a DNS based identity.

You're just moving the ownership of your identity from ICANN to some other system.
