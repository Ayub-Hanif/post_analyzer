That might be the way things go, but it has non-trivial operational complexity and costs that need to be accounted for. Same reason for the limited set of DID schemes.

I think a lot of the inspiration is just because it‚Äôs possible and free, since #atproto is open and free. So cool for devs

Almost every modern social app has an incredibly limited and hostile API while atproto/Bluesky is completely open.

Also very exciting is how much the protocol and SDKs could improve the DX to be more ergonomic and efficient.

I mean is this something you want users to do (at least power users) ? In comparison, radio mesh networks are seeking for new nodes, archivists are looking for more seeders, etc...

If not, then it is too easy for spoof accounts to operate. 

Any big named organisation on here that is not using it's domain name should not be trusted as valid.

What H2 streams help with is lowering the cost of making huge numbers of individual HTTP requests.

The long-term success of #atproto & bsky hinges on a thriving dev ecosys of diverse apps! I'm personally someone who'd only started using social media this year & had missed out on Twitter's heyday.

Now we have a rare 2nd chance to reimagine what social could be! Let's build!!

IMO, what's exciting ab ATP is its "everything-is-public" design re all user data

We used to be beholden to APIs of walled gardens (& saw how that turned out)

But once you build on ATP (assuming you don't EEE),all interop comes for free!

the lexicon is atproto's ad-hoc recreation of the semantic type system. there should be a different record type for every "triplet", thus you should only need a uhh dual-let. subject object, no predicate., Reply ID: -1709467196Reply Content: @gordon.bsky.social, Reply ID: 1940886332Reply Content: @ronent.bsky.social re synthesis you might be interested in @doriantaylor's IBIS/Intertwingler work.

No one can force existing legacy social apps to adopt a new protocol like atproto or open their APIs, so how can it be compatible?

Again, read what I said before. You're grossly underestimating the amount of effort that needs to go into protocol design., Reply ID: 337432350Reply Content: > "simply use a bog-standard AP protocol stack" in addition to #atproto.

I suggest you try spend one hour trying to design such a dual-head instance. There are a lot of issues to work out with regards to mapping identifiers between the two protocols, and ensuring that data can flow both ways.]

the @bsky.app team built this app, and can therefore ban users from it

those users can still post to the #atproto, but won't be shown here

am i understanding this right in the flowchart below?

Post ID: 1692495128Post Content: Login goes through PDS, so that should work. Here the problem is more the infrastructure - because to be really independent one has to run their own relay and the whole stack. So on the surface it's a separate application, but internally everyone is dependent on the Bluesky API in some way.

For technical people, it's very low effort to run your own PDS. You rent a ~$5/mo server and run the handy installer script.

Not at all necessary but it's cool!

(supported by the underlying protocol but not in the app yet)

But when the primary handle is .nytimes.com it could be showing an Affiliation Badge today!

Post ID: 1148164722Post Content: Yeah there's a huge amount of space in what #atproto allows to have even multiple third parties doing different verifications. This is ripe for market solutions, plural.

The missing middle is a way to show a "badge" that people easily trust in-app or on the web experience.

Post ID: 612871611Post Content: My #Swiftlang #AProto API library, ATProtoKit, has been updated to 0.21.0.

The way you authenticate has been tweaked a little. This will help with implementing OAuth but managing the session should hopefully be a little easier.

More tweaks will be on the way, but this is the first step.

You still need a resolver, and you can own your own domain name, so I don't see how a DID is functionally any different from a DNS based identity.

You're just moving the ownership of your identity from ICANN to some other system.
